# Useful commands

`cargo` is the Rust package manager and build tool, it is the equivalent of `dotnet` for C#.

## Creating a new project
`cargo new <project path>` creates a new blank project, for example, `cargo new rust-from-csharp` was used here.

## Build commands
`cargo check` checks the project for errors without doing a full build
`cargo build` builds the project
`cargo run` builds and runs the project
`cargo clean` cleans the project

## Testing commands
`cargo test` runs the tests
`cargo bench` runs the benchmark tests

## Other commands
`cargo fmt` formats the code
